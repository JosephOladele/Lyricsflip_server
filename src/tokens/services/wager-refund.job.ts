/**
 * Refunds wagers whose pot has been open too long with at least one player
 * never having staked.
 *
 * Without this sweep, a wager where one player stakes and the other never
 * signs stays `AWAITING_STAKES` forever: the pot stays `Open` on-chain with
 * one stake locked in it, and the only way out was an operator calling
 * refund code by hand.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction: each pass only selects wagers still
 * `AWAITING_STAKES`, and {@link WagerService.resolveWagerAsDraw} moves a
 * wager out of that status as its very first step (to `SETTLING`, then
 * `REFUNDED` or `FAILED`), so a wager this run picks up is never picked up by
 * a run that overlaps it.
 *
 * Runs under a Postgres advisory lock via {@link JobLockService} so that with
 * multiple instances only one of them performs the sweep per tick.
